Collection of tools relevant to delivering Atlassian cloud migrations

As a freelancer, I do a lot of Atlassian support work, in consulting engagements through my own companies and others. In the course of doing that, I often spot gaps in tools where it helps to leave a breadcrumb for others to avoid rapid graying of hair and shouting into the void. 

Please, if you find them useful, let me know.
